# DevOps-pipeline
Building a DevOps pipeline using a cloud source repository, cloud build, and container registry. 
Specifically, I am first creating a git repository, and then I will write a simple Python application and add it to my repository. 
After that you will test your web application in cloud shell and then define the build. you will use cloud build to create a docker image and store the image in container registry then you will see how to automate builds using triggers. once you have the trigger you will test it by making a change to your program and pushing that change to your git repo
